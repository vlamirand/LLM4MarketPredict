## Project Description
The LLM4MarketPredict project is dedicated to a comprehensive investigation of the potential of Large Language Models (LLM) technologies for analyzing and forecasting financial market data. The project aims to deeply understand the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly transformers, in financial analysis and forecasting tasks.

Stage 1: Testing Existing Transformer Models
The first stage of the project involves selecting and testing existing open-source transformer models on test and real financial market data. The primary task at this stage is to assess the ability of ready-made models to analyze and forecast, as well as their applicability in the context of potential earnings in financial markets. Experiments will include working with various datasets, including historical data from cryptocurrency exchanges, to check the models' effectiveness under different conditions.

Stage 2: Development and Experiments with Own Models
The second stage of the research plans to develop and test own models based on the transformer architecture, as well as experiments with modifications of existing architectures. The goal of this stage is to explore to what extent individual tuning and development of models can improve forecasting results compared to ready-made solutions.

Stage 3: Fine-tuning Advanced LLMs from Leading Companies
The final stage will focus on fine-tuning advanced LLMs developed by leading AI companies, such as Facebook (Meta) or creators of Mistral AI. This stage will involve working with large pre-trained models adapted to the specifics of forecasting tasks in financial markets. The main goal is to assess the potential and effectiveness of fine-tuning such models on specialized data and to identify new opportunities for increasing the accuracy of forecasts.

The project's goal is to conduct a deep analysis and assessment of the potential of artificial intelligence technologies, especially transformers and LLMs, for forecasting tasks in financial markets. In addition to the scientific contribution to understanding the capabilities and limitations of modern AI models in financial analytics, the project also aims to significantly enhance the author's knowledge and practical skills in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
